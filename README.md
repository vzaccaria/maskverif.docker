# Build the MaskVerif container

First you must build the container:

```
make build-container
```

Then you can run a test on a file (see below)

# Run a test on a file

If you have `example.mv` in your directory, type

```
make test-example
```

Same thing for any file `xyz.mv` type:

```
make test-xyz
```
